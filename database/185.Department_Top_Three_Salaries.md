# 185. Department Top Three Salaries

Level: **Hard**

The `Employee` table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

```
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
```

The `Department` table holds all departments of the company.

```
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
```

Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows.

```
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

```sql
SELECT
  e2.Name AS Department,
  e1.Name AS Employee,
  e1.Salary

FROM Employee e1

  JOIN Department e2 ON e1.DepartmentId = e2.Id

WHERE 3 > (
  SELECT count(DISTINCT e2.Salary)
  FROM Employee e2
  WHERE e2.Salary > e1.Salary AND e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
)
  
ORDER BY e2.Name, e1.Salary DESC
