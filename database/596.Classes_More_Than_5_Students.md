# 596. Classes More Than 5 Students

Level: **Easy**

There is a table `courses` with columns: student and class

Please list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.

For example, the table:

```
+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
```

Should output:

```
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
```

**Solution**

```sql
SELECT class
FROM courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING count(DISTINCT student) >= 5
```

```sql
SELECT c.class
FROM (SELECT
        count(DISTINCT student) stu,
        class
      FROM courses
      GROUP BY class) c
WHERE c.stu >= 5
```
