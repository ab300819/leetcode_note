# 177. Exchange Seats

Level: **Medium**

Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table `seat` storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.<br>

The column **id** is continuous increment.<br>
Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.<br>
Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?<br>

```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

For the sample input, the output is:

```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

**Solution**

```sql
SELECT
  (
    CASE
    WHEN mod(id, 2) != 0 AND seats != id
      THEN id + 1
    WHEN mod(id, 2) != 0 AND seats = id
      THEN id
    ELSE id - 1
    END
  ) AS id,
  student
FROM
  seat,
  (SELECT count(*) AS seats
   FROM seat) AS last_seat
ORDER BY id ASC
```

```sql
SELECT
  s1.id                            AS id,
  COALESCE(s2.student, s1.student) AS student
FROM seat s1
  LEFT JOIN seat s2 ON ((s1.id + 1) ^ 1) - 1 = s2.id
ORDER BY s1.id
```
